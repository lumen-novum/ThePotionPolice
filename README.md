## ✨ Inspiration  
We liked the challenge and the clarity that **EOG** provided.  
Our mindset aligned with EOG’s core values of **safety, accountability, and operational efficiency** — and we wanted to capture those principles in a creative, magical way.

## 🧠 What It Does  
**Real-Time Potion Flow Monitoring:**  
Tracks potion volumes by the minute to ensure a quick response in case of mismatches between clients and the company.  

Think of it as a watchful guard for every drop of potion — no leaks, no tricks, just pure precision. 🧴💫

## ⚙️ How We Built It  

### 🪄 Frontend  
**Streamlit** — to display graphs and results in a clean, interactive dashboard.  

### 🧪 Backend  
**Python Libraries (Requests, Pandas)** — to fetch EOG’s API data and process analytics behind the scenes.

🧭 *By combining EOG’s mission with our own sense of curiosity and creativity, we brewed up a system that turns data into insight — and potions into performance!* ✨
