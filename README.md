## ✨ Inspiration  
We were inspired by **EOG’s focus on safety, accountability, and operational efficiency** — values that align perfectly with our idea.  
We wanted to bring a bit of *magic* into the world of real-time monitoring — so we brewed up **The Potion Police**, where data meets digital potions!  

---

## 🧠 What It Does  
**The Potion Police** keeps an eye on every drop of potion in real time — tracking and visualizing flow data to make sure everything runs smoothly.  

💧 **Real-Time Potion Flow Monitoring**  
- Tracks potion volumes *by the minute*  
- Detects mismatches between client reports and company data  
- Sends alerts faster than you can say *“Accio efficiency!”*

## 🏗️ How We Built It  

### ⚡ Frontend  
- **Streamlit** — for fast, interactive dashboards and visualizations  
- Designed to make complex data look *magically simple*  

### 🧰 Backend  
- **Python (Requests, Pandas)** — to fetch and clean EOG’s API data  
- **Data analytics scripts** to crunch the numbers and generate results in real time  

---

## 💡 The Magic Behind It  
We combined EOG’s real-world values with a fun, fantasy twist — showing that even in the world of potions, safety and efficiency matter.  

> “Because even magic needs monitoring.” ✨
